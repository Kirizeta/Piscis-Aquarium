                <h3>Clownfish, or anemonefish, are a group of tropical reef fishes found in the warm waters of the Indian Ocean, Red Sea and western Pacific Ocean. There are 30 recognized species of clownfish, all but one of which belong to the genus Amphiprion. The only species in the genus Premnas, the maroon clownfish, is distinguished from all other clownfish by the presence of a spine on its cheek.</h3>
                <br>
                <h3>Clownfish live at the bottom of shallow seas at depths of 10-50 feet (3-15 m) in sheltered rocky or coral reefs. Their alternative name, anemonefish, reflects the symbiotic relationship these fish form with sea anemones. Clownfish are omnivores and eat a variety of prey items, but feed primarily on zooplankton including copepods, isopods and tunicate larvae. In addition to this, clownfish also eat algae, as well as the uneaten prey items and dead tentacles of their host anemones.</h3>
                <br>
                <h3>Clownfish associate in small groups consisting of a single, monogamous breeding pair and a few non-breeding juvenile males. A strict dominance hierarchy exists in each group, whereby the female is always the largest, followed by the breeding male. The smaller non-breeding males decrease in size further down the hierarchy.</h3>
                <br>
                <h3>Clownfish reproduce via external fertilization in which females lay their eggs on a flat rock surface close to their host anemone, then males swim over the eggs and fertilize them. Females lay between 100 and 1500 eggs depending on their maturity. Spawning occurs around the time of the full moon, possibly so that hatching coincides with high tides, which might help hatchlings escape predators by sweeping them away. Clownfish eggs typically hatch 6-10 days after fertilization, depending on the water temperature.</h3>
                <br>
                <h3>The taxonomic order of clownfish is currently uncertain as it is not known exactly how they relate to other groups of fish. Although clownfish species were historically identified and grouped using morphological features, modern genetic techniques have revealed the true relationships within the clownfish subfamily, conveying that genetic relatedness does not always correspond with morphological similarity.</h3>
                <br>
                <h3>The most well-know species of clownfish, thanks to the popular film Finding Nemo, is the ocellaris clownfish. Although the name clownfish reflects the bright orange pigmentation and white stripes of this and other species, not all species look the same. Clownfish range from being pale pink though to dark brown and have varying numbers of white or even golden stripes.</h3>
